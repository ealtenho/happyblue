//In this file we need code to
//1) Evaluate the responses the user has
//2) If the user has not put in valid info - we need error highlighting
//3) We need a way to remove the error highlighting the next time the user clicks
//4) If the input is good, we need to save that reflection to local storage to use in the journal
